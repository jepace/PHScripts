======
ubhpal
======

ubhpal is a suite of tools for eliminating duplicate copies of files
downloaded using ubh.  

It creates a database of MD5 hashes of the files; if a file with the
same checksum is encountered, the user is prompted to pick which of
the two to keep, and the other is deleted.  Other tools in the suite
allow renaming and deleting of files.

The relevant programs are:

    ubhpal      Look for collisions in directory tree
    ubhmv       Move a file in the database to a new location
    ubhrm       Mark a file as unwanted, and delete it
    ubhdump     Print contents of ubhpal database
    ubhlib.pm   Library of helper functions

-----
To Do
-----
Locking on the database when running.
Trap signals (such as kill) and close gracefully.
Implement 'ubhmv' to rename a file, or change it's directory.
perldoc ubhlib.pm
Do the require's better!
Other info (size) in the database? (many false collisions with md5?)
Incorporate directly into ubh
Better user input mechanism.
QA suite
Performance measurement
Other db format?
mysql interface?
